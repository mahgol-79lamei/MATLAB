#Question1:
Ù‹Consider a table (m*n) of English letters and a list of words. The goal is to find the location of the words in this table. 
The size or size of letters and words is not important and the word may be placed in any of the 8 horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions.
In the first line of this fable, two integers m and n that indicate the dimensions of the table are written.
In the following file, the letter S is shown in the next line after the number of words with an integer. After that, the words come in separate lines.
my program reads an input file named in.txt containing a table of letters and words. After finding the location of each word in the table, they are placed in an output file named out.txt.
In this file, first the word and then the row and column number of the first letter in the letter table are written.
If it does not exist in the table, instead of the row and column, 0 is written in front of it
